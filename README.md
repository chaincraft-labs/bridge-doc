## Introduction

The bridge enables connections between different blockchain networks, thus facilitating interoperability between them. This project aims to provide a thorough understanding of its operation, as well as guidelines for its use and integration.

## Bridge Documentation

In this section, you will find detailed information about:

- Bridge functionalities
- Use cases
- Security limitations and considerations

## Architecture Diagrams

Architecture diagrams illustrating the structure and operation of the bridge are available here. These diagrams help visualize the interaction between different system components.
