## Introduction

The bridge enables connections between different blockchain networks, thus facilitating interoperability between them. This project aims to provide a thorough understanding of its operation, as well as guidelines for its use and integration.

## Bridge Documentation

In this section, you will find detailed information about:

- [Bridge smart contracts](./bridge_smart_contracts/README.md)
- [p2p network - relayer | validator](./bridge_nodes/README.md)

## Architecture Diagrams

Architecture diagrams illustrating the structure and operation of the bridge are available here. These diagrams help visualize the interaction between different system components.
