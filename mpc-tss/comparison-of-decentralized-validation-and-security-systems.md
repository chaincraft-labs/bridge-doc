# Comparison of Decentralized Validation and Security Systems <!-- omit in toc -->

[back](../README.md)

MPC/TSS and Alternatives

## Overview <!-- omit in toc -->

This document provides a comprehensive comparison of different decentralized validation and security systems used in blockchain technology. We analyze various approaches ranging from Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to Proof of Stake (PoS), evaluating their security levels, performance characteristics, and practical applications. Each system offers unique trade-offs between security, efficiency, and complexity, making them suitable for different use cases in the blockchain ecosystem.

## MPC (Multi-Party Computation)

- Multiple parties collaborate to perform computations without revealing their private data.
- High cryptographic security.
- Applications: Secure signatures, confidential transactions.
- Advantages: High security, no party can compromise the system alone.
- Disadvantages: High complexity, requires intensive computation and communications.

## TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme)

- A private key is shared between multiple parties.
- Only a subset of participants need to sign to validate a transaction.
- Advantages: High security with decentralization of keys.
- Disadvantages: Complexity in signature management and aggregation.

## BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance)

- Network of nodes that reach consensus despite malicious nodes.
- Used in blockchains like Hyperledger and Tendermint.
- Pros: Resilient to attacks, good for permissioned networks.
- Cons: Limited scalability, latency in large networks.

## ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs)

- Allows to prove knowledge without disclosing the information itself.
- Used for confidentiality in systems like Zcash.
- Advantages: Maximum confidentiality, compact proofs.
- Disadvantages: High complexity, difficult to implement in complex systems.

## Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS)

- Splitting a private key into multiple fragments.
- Used to share the responsibility of key management.
- Advantages: Simple to implement, strong cryptographic security.
- Disadvantages: Not suitable for dynamic computations or real-time shared signature.

## Federated Consensus

- A group of predefined participants approves transactions (Ripple).
- Pros: Low latency, fast for closed networks.
- Cons: Less decentralized, risk of collusion between members.

## Proof of Stake (PoS) avec Slashing

- Validators place a stake to secure the network.
- Penalties (slashing) in case of malicious behavior.
- Advantages: Economically incentivized, energy efficient.
- Disadvantages: Risk of centralization, economic vulnerabilities.

| BFT | Medium to High | Medium | Medium | Permissioned blockchains |
| ZKP | Very High | Low | Very Complex | Confidential transactions |
| SSS | High | Low | Simple | Key sharing |
| Federated Consensus | Medium | Very Low | Simple | Closed networks (Ripple) |
| PoS | Medium to High | Medium | Medium | Public networks (Ethereum) |
